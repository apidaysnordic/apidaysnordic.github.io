## Four Lessons From 10+ Years of APIs
 
You probably have an API in 2015, and you probably didnâ€™t have one in 2005. During that 10 year period, thousands of companies published public APIs. Even with an API already launched, you now have the opportunity to learn from this period of significant change. The amount of value your API will generate in the future can be determined by these four historical lessons:

1. You can scale your business with outside developers
2. You may regret making your API public
3. Your API is of tremendous value to someone* (*not everyone)
4. Your API has more possibility than you can build

Have you internalized these lessons into your API yet?

The history of APIs expands beyond the most recent 10 years. The success of early entrants provide an excellent source of inspiration still applicable today. Modern APIs, and the developer excitement that goes with them, really began with the 2005 release of the Google Maps API. The search giants geographic platform is presently on over 1 million websites, yet even it had lessons to learn during this transformative decade.
