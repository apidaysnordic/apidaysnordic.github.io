## Designing a new API from scratch?
 
What things do you need to consider? In this talk, Paul will chat about some of the design decisions around building a new API for Saasu, one of Australia's leading online accounting software providers, and what practical considerations have been taken to make the new Saasu API easy to consume, and flexible enough to meet future needs for years to come. While Saasu uses predominantly Microsoft technology, generic topics will be discussed such as versioning approach, hypermedia usage, authentication and other aspects you can talk about at dinner parties. This talk was also presented at the Sydney API days conference with some minor refinements.

Paul is currently the CTO of Saasu and has also worked with Datacom, readify and EDS. Paul has written 3 technical books, is a major nerd, 5th degree black belt and industry veteran.
