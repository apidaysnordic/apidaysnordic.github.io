## JavaScript for APIs
 
Adoption of JavaScript sets the stage for the biggest shift in enterprise application development in more than a decade. - [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/The+Dawn+Of+Enterprise+JavaScript/fulltext/-/E-RES120686)

This workshop aims to help developers who are competent in other languages and environments become familiar with the JavaScript language and its ecosystem, both client-side and server-side. Many types of applications can be built with JavaScript these days. This workshop focuses on the important aspects of the language and ecosystem when exposing and consuming APIs.

The workshop will be an engaging mix of lecture and instructor-led hands-on coding exercises using the latest version of JavaScript and modern tools and libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem. There will be opportunities to collaborate with others in the workshop and engage in rich conversation about the materials covered.

### Learning Objectives

1. Attendees will become more familiar with:
 * Consuming APIs over HTTP in the context of a web-based application
 * Orientation around JavaScript full stack including node.js 
 * Current state of JavaScript language including ES6
 * JavaScript ecosystem including build tools e.g. Gulp
 * Layered testing in JavaScript and appropriate tools e.g. Jasmine, Sinon, Mocha, Chai
 * Asynchronous JavaScript programming with callbacks and promises
 * Key aspects of the JavaScript language used when working with APIs
2. Attendees will have fun. Fun is mandatory.

### Pre-Requisites

* Experience with a curly bracket or dynamic language e.g. C, C++, Java, C#, Python
* Your own laptop
* A github account

Come and learn the foundational practices of JavaScript and its ecosystem so you can write code that can be easily understood and maintained over time.

### About your instructors

Don has spent the entire two decades of his programming career on the bleeding edge. He has used a wide array of programming languages on most of the popular desktop and mobile platforms and many of the popular backend web/cloud platforms. For the past 5 years he has been building solutions with modern frontend web technologies. During his 12 years at Microsoft, he built developer guidance, lead projects and teams, organized and spoke at global conferences, and designed and taught purpose-built programming curriculum. Since then he has built concept prototypes for keynotes at global conferences, tackled enterprise deployment in the startup space, and mentored fellow developers. Don is a strong proponent of open source software and coding for social impact.

Rich spent the first part of his career as a paediatric intensive care nurse at Auckland's Starship Hospital. A long-time Linux geek and web developer, he graduated from Enspiral Dev Academy and now works as a free lance developer. He gets excited by open source technologies, native mobile programming, and hammocks. Any wombat or aardvark sightings are probably his fault.
