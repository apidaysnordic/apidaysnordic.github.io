The Dutch Environmental Act is one of the largest legislative acts since the establishment of The Netherlands in 1815 and the largest government IT challenge in its history. Basically it means that 26 acts (consisting of 4,700 articles) are integrated into one act (with 349 articles), making it easier for everyone to see what is allowed at a certain location. 

In this presentation we will dig into the government’s challenges of dealing with decentralized systems and getting help from the ‘Large Set of Unknown Developers’ in a ‘Large Set of Unknown Domains’ using semantically enriched APIs with extensive content-negotiation to support as many clients as possible while maintaining compatibility for existing information systems like GIS (Geo Information System) or Linked Data solutions.
