## The Hypermedia API Pivot
  
Cemplicity is a young and fast growing company specialising in patient experience management.

Although relatively new, parts of our software platform were inherited from another company in our group;  a blessing for speed to market but a problem with complexity and tightly bound strategies of yesteryear.
In this talk I will outline our journey from the code straight jacket, through a Hypermedia API pivot, which ultimately has provided us with a simplified backbone to evolve internally and across boundaries.

Bio:

Nick is the Founder of Cemplicity.  He has been working around software for 20 years.
