## API Management â€“ A Government Perspective
 
Each year hundreds of thousands of businesses and individuals interact with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) across a diverse range of services in a variety of ways. APIs are seen as a key tool for improving the ease of doing business with MBIE in many areas by reducing reliance on websites, giving improved access to information, and allowing customers to easily access services via third party products. This talk describes how MBIE has successfully utilised APIs, initiatives that are underway to increase use of the API channel, and the considerations that are involved with providing government services as APIs.
