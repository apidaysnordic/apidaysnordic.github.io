There is currently a major shift sweeping over the software industry. We went from monolithic apps, to API-driven apps, and now software engineers are breaking their apps into "micro-services".
Managing and connecting those different micro-services could be a hassle for DevOps.
AWS offers an interesting service with Lambda that let you create microservices easily for a very cheap price. With the recent announcement of the API gateway, it lets you create a 100% serverless microservice-based infrastructure for your API and app.

To simplify the creation and the maintenance of a such infrastructure, the community have came up with a framework: Serverless (previously: JAWS)
In this talk we will cover serverless principles using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework to build APIs.

## Nicolas Grenié, 3Scale

Nicolas is a Hacker in Residence at 3scale living between Barcelona and San Francisco.

Nicolas built his first website in 2000 using Microsoft Word, and since them did not stop learning about programming.

This "API freak" likes to try new languages and APIs all the time. He has built many integrations for Slack or Amazon Echo.
He runs many meetups in Barcelona around APIs, Meteor and Entrepreneurship.

When not working you have a good chance to find him hacking on side projects or enjoying a good craft beer. And of course, as he is French, frog and snails are part of his daily diet!
