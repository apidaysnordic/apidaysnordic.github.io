The APIDays NZ team is dedicated to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming conference environment for everyone. We are releasing this code of conduct to clearly outline our expectations.

We look forward to all attendees and sponsors help in making this a reality.

## Be respectful to one another

1. Respect yourself, and respect others.
2. Unwelcome behaviour will not be tolerated whether to other attendees, organisers, venue staff or other patrons of the APIDays NZ venues. Unwelcome behaviours include intimidation, harassment, abusive, discriminatory or derogatory conduct by any attendees of APIDays NZ and related events. All APIDays NZ venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
3. Be careful. Please keep an eye out for dangerous activity or situations, and alert the conference team if you become aware of any safety hazards.

Our goal is to create a safe and harassment-free conference experience for all involved, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, preferred operating system, programming language or text editor.

Or more simply put  "don't be a jerk!"

### What is Harassment?

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

### Anyone asked to stop harassing behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the conference without refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a conference organiser or helper immediately either at the registration desk or use one of the conference team contacts listed here.

The APIDays NZ team will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, to provide escorts, or to otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.

We expect all conference participants to abide by this code of conduct at all conference venues and conference-related social events.

We value your attendance and appreciate your help.
