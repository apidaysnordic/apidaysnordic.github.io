We are delighted that Mark will be now be coming to API Days NZ (sadly Medhi, founder of API Days, can no longer attend the conference due to family reasons).

Mark will be joining us from the UK to help MC the conference and share a brief preview of a new report on Banking APIs he will be publishing later in the year.
