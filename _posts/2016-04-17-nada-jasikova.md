Join me for an API life cycle walkthrough. We'll start with an initial API design and collaborate on it with others on GitHub. We'll iterate on the design and verify the prototype makes sense before going any further. Finally, we'll test the API implementation and show how to make sure the API documentation is always up to date.

I'll also introduce you to MSON - our Markdown Syntax for Object Notation that helps to keep your data description neat, compact and DRY.

Talk outline (~35 mins): API life cycle - Introduction, Designing API using API Blueprint and MSON, Collaborating with others on your API Project via GitHub, Prototyping API design with Mock Server, API implementation, Dredd - Testing the API implementation, Dredd in CI - Keeping API documentation up-to-date
