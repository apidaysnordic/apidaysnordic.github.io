## APIs for Amnesty
 
Amnesty International NZ is part of Amnesty International, a global movement of individuals who protect and defend human rights.

We do this by investigating and exposing abuses, mobilising our movement of over 7 million supporters from 150 countries worldwide to take action.

The most common way that we mobilise our supporters is to use a petition, or a letter. Amnesty International started over 50 years ago as a call to action, asking the public, for the first time ever, to write letters on behalf of people who didn't have a voice, and we continue this tradition to this day. Only now, many of the letters are emails, often generated through a web form!

In this talk I will outline the benefits of the API we created including how it has helped automate part of our CRM process and protected us from change to our CRM system.
