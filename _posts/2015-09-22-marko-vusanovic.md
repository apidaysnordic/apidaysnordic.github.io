## Is that API secure? 
   
REST APIs are ubiquitous. HTTP is used to connect almost everything from web apps, mobile apps all the way to arduinos. But are those APIs secure? In the light of recent attacks, I'd like to walk through security mechanisms used with HTTP protocol and explain how to use them in order to expose your API in a secure way. Another important topic I plan to cover is transferring sensitive data and storing it while at rest. Having understanding of the above topic should help with understanding which APIs are secure and which ones are not and thus should not be used.

## Bio:

I currently work as a senior consultant at ThoughtWorks and I am heavily involved in web application development and delivery. Last few years I've spent a lot of time focusing on security and cryptography especially in terms of distributed applications.
