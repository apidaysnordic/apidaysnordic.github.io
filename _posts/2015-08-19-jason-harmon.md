## Design-first APIs in practice
 
API design has taken a front-seat in recent years. Designing in code can cause miscommunication and project delays we want to avoid. An emerging practice is using API specification formats to drive the development process. We'll look end-to-end, focusing on parallelizing work, improving feedback loops, and delivering high quality API products.
