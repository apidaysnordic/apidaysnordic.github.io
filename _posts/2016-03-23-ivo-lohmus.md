Guardtime has developed Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI) - a blockchain technology for ensuring data integrity at internet scale. As the signatures can be validated without trusting any third party and they never expire it is a perfect fit for government services. It allows to ensure and prove integrity of data, systems and processes.
