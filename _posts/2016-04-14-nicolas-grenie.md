Chat bots are invading our daily life. For example, your company is using Slack for team collaboration, and have installed dedicated bot to automate scrum meetings. You can also directly request a Uber ride from Facebook Messenger talking to a robots.

Most of the chat and messaging applications have now open APIs to build chat bots on their system. Slack itself just launched an “app directory” and have put $80M aside to invest in the bot business.
How could you be part of the bot revolution as a company? How should you apply the API to make it more API consumable? Which tools should you use?

In this talk we will cover the different aspects of bot building using APIs, the recommended tools as well as best practices for API designers.
