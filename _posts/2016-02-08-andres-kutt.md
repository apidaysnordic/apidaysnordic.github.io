## Andres Kütt, Lead architect of Estonian government information system

Andres has been building software for living since 1993 when he turned a passion into a job and started working as a programmer. 
Since then he has grown into roles involving management of people and, for the past ten years, management of complex information systems. 
The latter is supported by his studies at the System Design and Management programme at the MIT.
