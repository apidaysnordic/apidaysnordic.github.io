## Testing Web Services, Microservices and APIs
 
As we start our journey towards a microservices architecture, divisions in our solution that used to be implicit are being exposed. The growth of REST services is creating a new set of opportunities and challenges for our testers to explore. I’ll explain our existing approach to testing SOAP web services between the middleware and application layer across BNZ, describe how we currently use service virtualisation to isolate testing of our user interfaces, and talk about the tools and practices that have emerged to test REST services within our applications. Then I’ll share how I’m preparing our testers for the future by providing a self-development pathway for API, web services and microservices testing. I’ll share a few of the resources and practical exercises it contains, which may help your testing team develop their skills in this area too.
